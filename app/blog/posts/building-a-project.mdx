We’re a small team with a big idea: create a stock management system that syncs with Hepsiburada and Trendyol to help small businesses stay on top of their inventory. Armed with Go for the backend, React for the frontend, and a whole lot of determination, we’ve just begun. Experience? Barely any. Progress? Slow but steady. This isn’t a tale of a finished project—it’s the story of our first steps, our stumbles, and a journey that’s only starting to unfold.

## The Vision: A Simple Plan, A Steep Climb

It started with a straightforward goal: build a tool to track stock from e-commerce platforms like Hepsiburada and Trendyol. We pictured a dashboard with real-time updates, low-stock alerts, and a clean design—something small businesses could rely on. Go with Fiber would handle the backend, React would bring the frontend to life. Easy in theory, but as beginners, we quickly learned the gap between idea and execution is wider than it looks.

## Rough Beginnings: Crashes and Quick Fixes

We kicked off with the frontend, eager to make it shine. But right away, things broke. The app wouldn’t start—version mismatches threw us off. We’d picked the latest React, but our setup couldn’t handle it. After some frantic searching, we switched to an older version and got it running. Then another snag: the screen stayed blank because we were using an outdated startup method. A small tweak later, we had a blank canvas—hardly a win, but a start.

Every hiccup reminded us how little we knew. We weren’t experts; we were just persistent enough to keep digging for answers.

## Graph Dreams and Error Nightmares

Next, we wanted a stock trend graph on the dashboard—something visual to bring the data alive. We grabbed a charting library, hooked it up, and… crash. An error about missing pieces we didn’t understand. Hours of trial and error later, we found the fix buried online. The graph flickered on—not perfect, but proof we could figure things out, one stubborn step at a time.

## Style Struggles: From Bare to Bold

A polished UI was the dream—sliding menus, interactive cards. We chose TailwindCSS, expecting magic. Instead, we got a plain, lifeless page. We’d botched the setup, and even after fixing it, nothing changed. In desperation, we wiped the slate clean and reinstalled everything. Suddenly, colors popped, layouts snapped into place—it finally looked like something worth showing. A rookie mistake, a rookie save.

## Backend Basics: A Quiet Foundation

The backend was our safe haven. Go’s simplicity kept us grounded. It’s not plugged into Hepsiburada or Trendyol yet—just mock data for now—but it runs smoothly, waiting for us to catch up.

## Where We Stand: A Snapshot of Progress

So far, we’ve patched up the frontend, dodged some crashes, and laid the backend’s groundwork. It’s far from done—real integrations, more features, and plenty of hurdles lie ahead. We marked this milestone with a photo of demo view:

## Lessons From the Edge

- **Errors Teach**: Every crash is a lesson—patience pays off.
- **Teamwork Wins**: We’re not pros, but together we push forward.
- **Slow Is Okay**: Small steps beat standing still.

We’re just scratching the surface. Connecting to Hepsiburada and Trendyol, polishing the UI, building out features—it’s all on the horizon. As rookies, we’re tripping plenty, but we’re learning fast. The journey’s young, and we’re in it for the long haul!
